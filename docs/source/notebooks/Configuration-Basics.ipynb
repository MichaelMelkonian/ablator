Secondly, as the running config (either RunConfig or ParallelConfig) has an `ModelConfig` attribute, you will need to create a custom running config class as well (decorated with `configclass` decorator), updating `model_config` argument to type `ModelConfig`. Only after this can the running config object be used in ablator launcher.\n",

For example, the learning rate can be set as an independent variable and must be annotated as stateless. Additionally, there are variables that take different values between experiments and trials to which the state is agnostic, for example, a random seed or a directory path between execution environments can be annotated as stateless.\n",

Instead, the value is determined by internal experiment processes that can depend on other experimental attributes, such as the dataset. However, given the same initial state, the attribute is expected to result in the same value and is therefore deterministic. For example, the input size used in a model’s architecture that depends on the dataset will be annotated as Derived during the experiment design phase.\n",

So, you must provide it with these configuration objects. Moreover, training configuration also requires optimizer config. So these are the configuration objects that you should create. These configuration objects are just a way to isolate different parameters by functional type in machine learning.\n",

Next, `config` object combines the `training_config` and `model_config`, along with runtime settings like verbosity and device. Finally, the ProtoTrainer object `ablator` is created with a wrapper object and `config`, and `launch()` method is called to start the experiment. The returned metrics or results are stored in the metrics variable."
