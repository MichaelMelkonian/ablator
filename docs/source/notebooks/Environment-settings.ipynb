For the multi-node setting, you must first run `ray start` on the command line to start the Ray cluster services on the machine before `ray.init` in Python to connect to the cluster services. On a single machine, you can run `ray.init()` without `ray start`, which will both start the Ray cluster services and connect to them.\n",
